# Hey there! 👋 I'm Honore Niyomukiza

## 🌊 What I'm About

I'm a developer who loves turning ideas into reality. Whether it's a sleek web app, a mobile experience, or something completely out of left field—I'm here for it. 

Right now, I'm vibing with **Elixir/Phoenix** and building stuff that actually matters to people. Less "hello world," more "hello impact."

### 🎯 Current Focus
- 🏗️ Building fintech solutions that make people's lives easier
- 🎨 Crafting interfaces that feel good to use
- 🌱 Learning and experimenting (because why not?)
- ☕ Probably drinking coffee while doing all of the above

## 💻 What I Work With

```elixir
def lob_stack do
  %{
    languages: ["Elixir", "JavaScript", "TypeScript"],
    frontend: ["React", "LiveView", "TailwindCSS"],
    backend: ["Phoenix", "Node.js"],
    databases: ["PostgreSQL"],
    tools: ["Linux", "Git", "Docker", "VS Code"],
    currently_learning: "Whatever catches my interest next 🚀"
  }
end
```

## 🎨 The Vibe

I believe code should be:
- **Clean** → But not boring
- **Functional** → But fun to work with  
- **Scalable** → But not over-engineered

I'm all about that balance between getting stuff done and doing it right.

- 📚 Reading (both code and actual books)
- 🎧 Discovering new music
